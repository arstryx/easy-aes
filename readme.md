# About

Hello!

This repository contains simplified implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.

It was made for study purposes, so I hope it can demonstrate some basics on real but simple code.

Do not use this for any real and serious tasks, of course.

Maybe some updates can appear later.

Also playable online on my university [home page](https://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xzakha02/easy-aes/aes.html).

You can check detailed specifications online, there are many sources.

## Note

Some parts of the code were taken from [this repository](https://github.com/ricmoo/aes-js).
